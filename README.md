# IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service open source Ingress controller

The Ingress controller provided by this project can be used as-is in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service clusters without any support from IBM. The main purpose of providing this open source Ingress controller is to allow users to continue to use the custom IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service Ingress controller after official support is ended by IBM.

To get started, check out the following docs:
* [Deploy the Ingress controller](/docs/installation.md)
* [Configure optional settings for the Ingress controller](/docs/configurations.md)
* [Add annotations to Ingress resources](/docs/annotations.md)
